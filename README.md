... for Shoes!
</pre>

## About

Team Shoes needs to run tests to make Shoes. You make Shoes apps; you
probably want to test them too! Well, shoes-cucumber to the rescue!

## ... but not just yet

This project is in the 'primordial-ooze' stage. See that 0.0.1? Yeah.
I'm serious. So! It's probably not useful to you yet. But don't let me
stop you! Just know that it's quite limited.

## Using it

Just require 'shoes/cucumber' in your env.rb, and make sure you've got
'shoes-cucumber' in your Gemfile. Easy as pie!
